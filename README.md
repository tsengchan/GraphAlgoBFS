# GraphAlgoBFS
Study of the breadth first algorithm. 

This is the Breadth First Alogrithm. I've used NetworkX for the graph manipulations. 
As one can see the output is the traversal route; the attributes of the nodes starts off as white then gray when node is reached then black finally.

TO DO:

code for animated GIFS of the color changes of the nodes as traversing graph.
